## Overview

### The challenge

The challenge is to build out a dropdown navigation menu for a single-page website.

Users should be able to:

- View the relevant dropdown menus on desktop and mobile when interacting with the navigation links
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup.
- Flexbox.
- CSS Grid.
- Vanilla JavaScript.
- Mobile-first design.

### What I learned

- JavaScript conditionals to make all the interactivity of the page.
- My first approach to the mobile-first methodology.

### What can be improve

- JavaScript elements work on the second click.
- HTML can be more semantic and CSS could use BEM methodology.
- When JavaScript elements are activated by clicking they must be closed manually when someone uses the web browser inspector to change the screen size.
